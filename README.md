# SwiftNG
## Background
This project was started in the context of my bachelor's thesis on *Graph Similarity for Scientific Workflow Similarity Search* at the chair of *[Knowledge Management in Bioinformatics](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/gebiete/wbi)* (Humboldt University of Berlin). It was further refined and extended during subsequent research.

## Technical Notes
The project is developed on Windows using Visual Studio and compiled with the Intel C Compiler, although only few optimisations would be necessary to get it to compile on UNIX/Linux with gcc. 

The project relies on only two libraries apart from the C standard library:

* [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
